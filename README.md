# Lab | Superwars Stage 1

## Introduction

Dustin and Lucus are best friends. They spend their weekends watching superhero series and playing superhero games. One Friday at school Mr.Hooper, and their computer science faculty taught them HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Dustin & Lucus realized they could build super cool superhero stuff using their knowledge. 

The subsequent weekend, they decided to do it. Lucus and Dustin are now all set to build something super cool.

Lucus always loves protagonists like most of us. But Dustin is quite crazy, he likes antagonists. So they decided to collect a bunch of their favorite Super Heroes and Super Villains' names along with their pictures. Did they tell you about the game that they are gonna build? 

Okay, let us explain. They are going to facilitate the ultimate war between Super Heroes and Super Villains. As they are new to these technologies, they need a **Kalvian** to help them build this game.

## What should you do

Here is the boilerplate [link](https://stackblitz.com/edit/web-platform-p66wws?file=README.md) of the lab. Fork the project and get started with the lab.

## How To Submit


Save your lab project and submit your project link in this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FsIKaMGG8g_xISwHg0oGVQJpgHCXVRQGSQmpytu-b_o/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1483932328=CSK101-M2-L68.1).

### Progression : Build the arena & Have the players ready

1. Create an HTML document `index.html`.
2. Using `CSS Grid`, create 3 columns one each for Heroes, score, and Villains in the same order. Try to make it responsive and find the right size for each grid.
3. Add players to the left and right grids. Use the middle grid to showcase the scores.
4. Style the elements in `style.css`.

### Conditions

* Heroes should be on your left grid and Villains on the right grid.
* Heroes should be justified to the right and Villains to the left.
* Each player should have an image, name, and strength (Number). The image links of the superheroes are provided below
* Name and strength should be center aligned.
